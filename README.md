# Seng_403

This is an overview of how this Repository is structured:

Alias Script:
  This script was taken from the paper's original repo which is outlined in the source paper. We have made some changes to the mergeAliases.py file. In it's current stance it requires some CSV files for Input and Output which have not been provided. These files have been purposefully left out due to the recent mishaps dealing with GHTorrents.

Gender Computer:
  This script was taken from the paper's original repo which is outlined in the source paper. We have written a completely new main.py file that does all of the execution we require. In it's current stance it requires some CSV files for Input and Output which have not been provided. These files have been purposefully left out due to the recent mishaps dealing with GHTorrents.

Java Scripts:
  This is a new script written entirely by our group that connects to the MySQL database and does some statistical analysis that we need.
